# Python-Library-Management-System
Language :- Python Programming. In this program, I have created a simple Library Management System. Here you can add a book, lend a book, display books, return a book and also delete a existing book. While adding a book you will be asked to enter the Book Name. If you want to display all books you can simply choose Display option . While lending a book you will be asked to enter your Name and Book Name. While returning a book you will be asked same question as lending. Here comes the interesting part, while deleting a book you will be asked to enter the secret key. If the Secret Key do not match, a message will be displayed Incorrect Secret Key If the Secret Key matches then you can delete a book you want. I have used Visual Studio Code here.
